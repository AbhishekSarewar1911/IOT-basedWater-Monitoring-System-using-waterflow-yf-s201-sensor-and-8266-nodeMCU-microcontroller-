# IOT based WATER MONITORING SYSTEM USING ESP8266-nodeMCU-microcontroller & WATER FLOW SENSOR:
## Overview: IoT Water Flow Meter using ESP8266 & Water Flow Sensor
 

In this project we will learn how to make IoT Based Water Flow Meter using ESP8266 & Water Flow Sensor. We will interface YFS201 Hall Effect Water Flow Sensor with NodeMCU ESP8266 Board. We will display the water flow rate & Total Volume in 0.96â€³ OLED Display. We will then integrate the hardware with cloud based IoT Server. For IoT Server, we will use Thingspeak App. The water flow rate & volume data can be uploaded to Thingspeak Server & can be viewed/monitored from any part of the world.

 Water Management System is an important part of City Management. Water management involves supplying water according to the real requirement & without wasting Water. Therefore it is very important to measure water flow rate and volume. Without measuring these parameters, Water Management is almost impossible. Also monitoring the Water Volume, Flow Rate & Water Quality remotely using Internet Connectivity has become very essential. Therefore there is a need for Monitoring Water Management System Online.

 There are so many Water Flow Sensors available in the market but are too expensive to use and afford. As a result, a low-cost water flow meter is required. So we will use YFS201 Hall Effect Water Flow Sensor with ESP8266 & design simple IoT Based Water Flow Meter.
